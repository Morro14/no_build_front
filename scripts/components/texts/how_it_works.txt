The App allows you to create your personal catalog with entries which are connected to the remote file, files or directory (via link provided by the service). The catalog is saved on the Appâ€™s server side. It does not store any of your files from cloud services, only the data created in the App and the link to the remote file are stored. 
In order to navigate through your cloud storage the App will request you to connect to the service (with oAuth protocol) and ask for read-only permissions.
